#Definitions

  - ``` Graph ``` is a set of ``` vertices ``` and a collection of ``` edges ``` that connect those vertices.
  - Use ``` 0 ``` thru ``` V - 1 ``` to refer to the vertices
  - Use ``` v-w ``` or ``` w-v ``` to refer to an edge
  - ``` Self-Loop ``` is an edge that connects a vertex to itself.
  - ``` Parallel ``` edges connect the same two vertices.
  - ``` Simple ``` graphs are graphs that **do not possess** ``` self loops ``` and ``` parallel edges ```
  - ``` Adjacent ``` vertices are connected with an edge and the edge is ``` incident ``` to both the vertices.
  - ``` Degree ``` of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.
  - ``` Path ``` is a sequence of vertices connected by edges.
  - ``` Simple Path ``` is a ``` Path ``` with no repeated vertices
  - ``` Cycle ``` is a path with at least one edge whose first and last vertices are the same.
  - ``` Simple Cycle ``` is a cycle without repeated edges or vertices.
  - ``` Length ``` of a path or cycle is the number of edges.
  - ``` Connected Graphs ``` are graphs where there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex in the graph.
  - ``` Acyclic Graphs ``` are grapsh that do not have ``` Cycles ```
  - ``` Tree ``` is a an ``` acyclic ``` and ``` connected ``` graph.
  - ``` Forest ``` is a disjoint set of ``` Trees ```
  - ``` Density ``` of a graph is the proportion of possible pairs of vertices that are connected by edges
  - ``` Bipartite Graph ``` is a graph whose vertices we can divide into two sets such that all the edges connect a vertex in one set with a vertex in the other set.
